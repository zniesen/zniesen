## 🧠 About Me

I'm a recent graduate passionate about the intersection of neuroscience and data science. I’ve worked across developmental, affective, and computational neuroscience domains—analyzing fMRI data, modeling behavior, and even developing a web tool to improve accessibility for disabled individuals.

## 🧪 Recent Work

- 🧬 **Estrogen & Visuospatial Abilities** - Explored the relationship between estrogen levels and visuospatial task performance using behavioral testing and menstrual cycle tracking.
- 🔄 **Emotional Memory & Sensory Modality** - Examined how emotional distractors (happy, sad, neutral) across auditory and visual modalities impact working memory performance in a 2-back task.
- 🌐 **Sensory Space** – Developed a web scraping and review analysis system to evaluate accessibility for disabled individuals
- 👂👁️ **Cross-Modal Priming & Resting-State Lateralization** - Investigated how resting-state prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity correlates with speed and accuracy in a cross-modal language priming task using fNIRS.
- 🧠 **fMRI + Behavior** *(UGA NSURE)* - Studied the relationship between impulsivity, parenting style, and default mode network (DMN) connectivity using behavioral assessments and fMRI data.
- 🎥 **Emotional Clip Viewing & Social Behavior** - Explored participant responses to non-normative behavior during emotional video clips using physiological measures and self-report data.
- 🔬 **SBF-SEM Deep Learning** *(Max Planck Florida)* - Developed a deep learning model for segmenting mitochondria from SBF-SEM images using convolutional neural networks.
